# Hi, I'm Carlos

I'm a Chilean biochemist interested in understanding living organisms'
biochemical evolution through mathematical and computational models. In my spare
time, I'm a Neovim plugin developer and Julia Language enthusiast, as well as
a part-time photographer.

## What am I up to?
I'm currently doing my PhD at Université de Lille and Institut Pasteur de Lille
on developing a framework to study evolution from the point of view of cellular
metabolism using unconventional computational paradigms.

For a more in-depth view of my experience, please
refer to my [CV](./cv/cv_en_long.pdf) (también disponible en
[español](./cv/cv_es_largo.pdf)).

### Projects
#### Science
- [_De novo_ prediction of drug targets and candidates by chemical
  similarity-guided network-based
  inference](https://github.com/schuellerlab/ijms2022_simspread)
- [ResidueFisher](https://github.com/cvigilv/ResidueFisher), bioinformatics
  protocol that aims at mining information at the sequence and structure level
  of protein chain to detect possible evolutionary conserved residues

#### Neovim
- [diferente.nvim](https://github.com/cvigilv/diferente.nvim), a plugin for
  enhancing the UX of Git commits in Neovim, inspired in commitia.vim.
- [esqueleto.nvim](https://github.com/cvigilv/esqueleto.nvim), a plugin for
  managing template files in Neovim.
- [denote.nvim](https://github.com/cvigilv/denote.nvim), a plugin for
  simple notes for Neovim with an efficient file-naming scheme.


#### Julia Language
- [SimSpread.jl](https://github.com/schuellerlab/SimSpread.jl), a software package
  implements the SimSpread algorithm for link prediction in graphs.
- [HyperdimensionalComputing.jl](https://github.com/MichielStock/HyperdimensionalComputing.jl),
  a software package for hyperdimensional computing (HDC) in Julia.

#### Personal
- [recetario](https://github.com/cvigilv/recetario), a compendium of
  miscellaneous script for all things science, ML, DS, Julia, etc.
