# Hi, I'm Carlos

I'm a chilean biochemist interested in understanding living organisms'
biochemical evolution through mathematical and computational models. In my spare
time I'm a Neovim plugin developer and Julia Language enthusiast, as well as
part-time photographer.

## What am I up to?
I'm currently doing my PhD at Universite de Lille and Institute Pasteur de Lille
on developing a framework to study evolution from the point of view of cellular
metabolism.

For a more in-depth view of my experience, please
refer to my [CV](./cv/cv_en_long.pdf) (también disponible en
[español](./cv/cv_es_largo.pdf)).

### Projects
#### Science
- [De novo prediction of drug targets and candidates by chemical
  similarity-guided network-based
  inference](https://github.com/cvigilv/simspread)
- [ResidueFisher](https://github.com/cvigilv/ResidueFisher), bioinformatics
  protocol that aims at mining information at the sequence and structure level
  of protein chain to detect possible evolutionary conserved residues

#### Neovim
- [diferente.nvim](https://github.com/cvigilv/diferente.nvim), a plugin to
  enhance the UX of Git commits in Neovim.
- [esqueleto.nvim](https://github.com/cvigilv/esqueleto.nvim), a plugin for
  managing template files in Neovim.

#### Julia Language
- [SimSpread.jl](https://github.com/cvigilv/SimSpread.jl), a software package
  for the `Julia` programming language that implements the SimSpread formalism
    for link prediction in graphs.

#### Personal
- [recetario](https://github.com/cvigilv/recetario), a compendium of
  miscellaneous script for all things science, ML, DS, Julia, etc.
