# Hi, I'm Carlos
## Who am I?
Chilean biochemist interested in understanding living organisms' biochemical evolution
through mathematical and computational models. In my spare time I'm a Neovim plugin
developer and JuliaLanguage enthusiast, as well as part-time photographer.

## What have I done?
Please refer to my [CV](./cv/cv_en_long.pdf) for that information (también
disponible en [español](./cv/cv_es_largo.pdf)).

## Projects
### Science
- [De novo prediction of drug targets and candidates by chemical similarity-guided network-based inference](https://github.com/cvigilv/simspread)
- [ResidueFisher](https://github.com/cvigilv/ResidueFisher), bioinformatics protocol that aims at mining information at the sequence and structure level of protein chain to detect possible evolutionary conserved residues

### Neovim
- [diferente.nvim](https://github.com/cvigilv/diferente.nvim), a plugin to enhance the UX of Git commits in Neovim.
- [esqueleto.nvim](https://github.com/cvigilv/esqueleto.nvim), a plugin for managing template files in Neovim.
- [mateo.nvim](https://github.com/cvigilv/mateo.nvim), my personal Neovim configuration.

### JuliaLang
- [SimSpread.jl](https://github.com/cvigilv/SimSpread.jl)

### Personal
- [recetario](https://github.com/cvigilv/recetario), a compendium of miscellaneous script for all things science, ML, DS, Julia, etc.
